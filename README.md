Job submission application and recruiter navigational portal with machine learning library Brain.js

This application is a job recruitment platform that features web portals for both the job seeker and the job recruiter. By incorporating sample data about previous applicants' GPA, experience, and skills, it is able to determine the percent likelihood an applicant would be hired by using machine learning and a neural network. 

In addition, it is possible to correct the neural network in the event that applicants with qualifications that do not appear to be suitable, are in fact hired. This is called reinforcement learning and it was the final stage of the program that was missing, which had been added to make the application useful for companies such as Geico.
